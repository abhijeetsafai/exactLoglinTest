\maketitle 

Nuisance parameters are parameters that are not of direct interest to
the inferential question in hand. In a frequentist or likelihood
paradigm, a common tool for eliminating nuisance parameters is to
condition on their sufficient statistics. The same technique is useful
(though rarely used) in a Bayesian settings, as it eliminates the need
to put priors on nuisance parameters.

For log-linear models, conditional analysis suffers from two main drawbacks.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set of lattice points contained in the conditional distribution is difficult to manage, 
      computationally or analytically.
\item The sufficient statistics for the nuisance parameters are not ancillary to the 
      parameters of interest.
\end{enumerate}
In this manuscript we address only the first drawback using \texttt{exactLoglinTest}.

\section{The Problem} 

The observed data, $y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)$, are modeled as Poisson
counts with a means, $\mu = (\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n)$, satisfying $$ \log
\mu = x \beta $$ under the null hypothesis. Here $x$ is a full rank
$n\times p$ design matrix. It is easily shown that the sufficient
statistics for $\beta$ under the null hypothesis are $x^t y$, where a
superscript $t$ denotes a transpose. Let $h$ be a test statistic of
interest where larger values of $h$ support the alternative
hypothesis. Two examples are the Pearson Chi-Squared statistic and the
deviance. An exact test relative to $h$ can be performed via the
conditional P-value
$$
\mbox{Prob}\{h(y) \geq h(y_{obs}) | x^t y = x^t y_{obs}\} = \sum_{\{y
\in \Gamma\}} \frac{I\{h(y) \geq h(y_{obs})\}}{C \prod y_i!}  
$$ 
where $y_{obs}$ is the observed table, $C$ is a normalizing
constant and $\Gamma = \{y | x^t y = x^t y_{obs}\}$  (often referred
to as the reference set).

The term ``exact'' is used to refer to tests that guarantee the
nominal type I error rate unconditionally. Thus a test that never
rejects the null hypothesis is technically exact in any
situation. Therefore, exactness is not in itself a sufficient
condition for a test to be acceptable.  Moreover, this example (never
rejecting) is particularly relevant in our setting because $\Gamma$
may contain one or few elements. Hence the conditional P-value will be
exactly or near one regardless of the evidence in the data vis-a-vis
the two hypotheses.  However, it is also the case that the
conservative conditional tests can produce P-values that are smaller
than those calculated via Chi-squared approximations (see Subsection
\ref{path} for an example).

\subsection{Binomial Calculations}
\label{sec:binom}
Conditional inference for Poisson log-linear models contains
conditional inference for binomial-logit models as a special
case. Consider a binomial logit models of the form, $b_i \sim
\mbox{Bin}(n_i,p_i)$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$ and
\begin{equation}
\label{logitmodel}
 \mbox{logit}(p_{i}) = z_i \gamma + x_i' \beta,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is a scalar and $\beta$ is a $p$ dimensional vector.
Frequently, $x_i'$ contains only a strata indicator and an intercept
term. In this case conditioning on the sufficient statistic for
$\beta$ results in standard conditional logistic regression. For this
purpose, we suggest the \texttt{coxph} function as described in
\cite{vr:2002}. Instead we consider the more general case where
$\beta$ is arbitrary vector of nuisance parameters.  However, the
reader should again be warned that the loss of information from
conditioning can sometimes be quite severe in these problems and hence
produce useless results.


Consider testing $H_0 \gamma = 0$ versus some alternative.
The following model model is equivalent to the null modell for
\eqref{logitmodel}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:poisson}
y_{ij} \sim \mbox{Poisson}(\mu_{ij}) 
\hspace{.3in} 
\mbox{log}(\mu_{i1}) = \alpha_i + x_i' \beta
\hspace{.3in} 
\mbox{log}(\mu_{i2}) = \alpha_i,
\end{equation}
for $j=1,2$ and $i=1,\ldots,k$.  The sufficient statistics for the
$\alpha_i$ are $y_{i1} + y_{i2} = y_{i+}$. Then it is easy to show
that the conditional distribution of $y_{i1} | y_{i+}$ is precisely
the model given by \eqref{logitmodel} where
\begin{eqnarray*}
  p_i & = &\mu_{i1} / \mu_{i+} \\
  b_i & = & y_{i1} \\
  n_i & = & y_{i+}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, conditioning out the nuisance parameters $\{\alpha_i\}$ and
$\beta$ for the Poisson log-linear model yields exactly the same
(null) conditional distribution as conditioning out $\beta$ in model
\eqref{logitmodel}.  Furthermore, this exercise indicates exactly how
to perform the calculations, which is useful since \texttt{exactLoglinTest} only
accepts models in the form of Poisson log-linear models.

Currently \texttt{exactLoglinTest} is useful for tests of $\gamma = 0$. With
modifications, the central ideas could be used to calculate a Monte
Carlo estimate of the conditional likelihood for $\gamma$. (It is
possible to use \mcexact as is for this purpose. However, we have had
mixed success in this endeavor and it is best avoided due to numerical
instability.)

\section{\texttt{exactLoglinTest}} 
The software \texttt{exactLoglinTest} is an implementation of the algorithms presented
in \cite{booth:butler:1999} and \cite{caffo:booth:2000}.  At the heart
of both algorithms is a sequentially generated rounded normal
approximation to the conditional distribution. We refer the reader
to those papers for a more complete description.

You can obtain a copy of \texttt{exactLoglinTest} at as well as a no-web \cite{leisch}
version of this document at
\begin{verbatim}
http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~bcaffo/downloads.htm
\end{verbatim}
You can install \texttt{exactLoglinTest} with \texttt{R CMD INSTALL}, on Unix and
Linux, while the binaries are available for Windows. Assuming it is
installed, one can load \mcexact with
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> library(exactLoglinTest)
> set.seed(1)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
Here, the optional argument \texttt{lib.loc} is necessary if
the package has been installed into one of the paths that R automatically
checks. We also set the random number seed to a specific value which is
a good practice for Monte Carlo procedures.

\section{Examples}
\subsection{Residency Data}
Assuming \texttt{exactLoglinTest} has been properly installed, the residency data can
be obtained by the command
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> data(residence.dat)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
This data is a 4$\times$4 table of persons' residence in 1985 by
their residence in 1980. See Table \ref{tab:res} for the complete
data.  The data frame, \texttt{residence.dat}, contains the counts
stacked by the rows. The extra term \texttt{sym.pair} is used to fit
a quasi-symmetry model.  For details on the quasi-symmetry model see
\cite{agre:1990}.  To obtain a Monte Carlo goodness of fit test of
quasi-symmetry versus a saturated model involves the following command
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> resid.mcx <- mcexact(y ~ res.1985 + res.1980 + factor(sym.pair), 
+     data = residence.dat, nosim = 10^2, maxiter = 10^4)
> resid.mcx
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
                deviance    Pearson
observed.stat 2.98596233 2.98198696
pvalue        0.46311695 0.46311695
mcse          0.03679595 0.03679595
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

The default method is the importance sampling of
\cite{booth:butler:1999}. Using this method, the number of desired
simulations \texttt{nosim} may not be met in \texttt{maxiter}
iterations and no warning is issued if this occurs. The returned value
is a list storing the results of the Monte Carlo simulation and all of
the relevant information necessary to restart the simulation.  More
information can be obtained with \texttt{summary}
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> summary(resid.mcx)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
Number of iterations       =  100 
T degrees of freedom       =  3 
Number of counts           =  16 
df                         =  3 
Next update has nosim      =  100 
Next update has maxiter    =  10000 
Proportion of valid tables =  1 

                deviance    Pearson
observed.stat 2.98596233 2.98198696
pvalue        0.46311695 0.46311695
mcse          0.03679595 0.03679595
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
The $t$ degrees of freedom refers to degrees of freedom used as a
tuning parameter within the algorithm while the \texttt{df} refers to
the model degrees of freedom. In this case, the Monte Carlo standard
error, \texttt{mcse}, seems too large. As mentioned previously,
\mcexact, stores the relevant information for restarting the
simulation
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> resid.mcx <- update(resid.mcx, nosim = 10^4, maxiter = 10^6)
